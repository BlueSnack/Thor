    <hr>
    <div class="blog">
        <p id="fir"> Rising before the alarm clock (set at an unfriendly 5.00 am) was activated, we washed and dressed,
            listening
            in
            silent anticipation to the awakening forest. Our torch beams probed the darkness as we walked from our tent
            to
            the balloon launch site. Extreme caution was required on the short journey because the path we were
            following
            was often used by hippos returning from a night’s foraging and the odd Cape Buffalo out for a nocturnal
            stroll.
        </p>
        <p>
            After about 10 minutes of inflation, the balloons began to take shape. The welcome silence following the
            fans being shut down was suddenly filled by a whoosh of gas. Then came a glorious burst of flame as the gas
            was ignited.
        </p>
        <p>
            Adrenaline shot through my body. I had chosen to position myself inside one of the balloons’ envelopes in
            order to capture on film the dramatic colours of the burner’s incoming flame.

            A few final bursts of colourful flame brought the balloon – and us – to the point of lift-off. Our hearts
            thumped with excitement at the spectacular sight of the other balloons rising – and then it was our turn.
            The wicker basket scuffed along the ground until suddenly we were drawn upward towards the waiting heavens.

            There are no words to describe the feeling of those first few moments of flight. As we rose into the warmth
            of the sun, we were gently gathered up by the wind and carried towards the romance of the vast African
            Plains.
        </p>
        <p>
            Only an intermittent burst of flame interrupted the profound silence as the pilot adjusted the temperature
            of the air inside the balloon. The basics of balloon are easy – hotter air to climb, cooler air to descend.
            It takes great skill and practice, however, to anticipate what is required. Wind alone was our propulsion,
            and we were fortunate to be wafting along with a gentle current that allowed us time to absorb all the
            magnificence around us. The Serengeti and Masai Masai ecological systems are fascinating enough to behold
            from a car, but from a balloon’s vantage point, they are truly awe-inspiring.

            Exclamations erupted as animals were spotted. All the passengers have become bonded by our shared enthusiasm
            for this very special occasion. Our Japanese companion was especially overwhelmed. It was extraordinary how,
            for one short hour, every land-locked barrier of language and culture just evaporated in the face of this
            larger unifying reality.
        </p>
        <p>
            Suddenly the clatter of petrol engines obliterated the early hush. The engines were necessary to power the
            huge
            fans used to force large amounts of air into the balloon’s envelopes. This was just the first stage in the
            balloon-inflation process and while the fans were running, the ground crew and pilots meticulously checked
            all
            the lines and rigging – a reassuring sight for us prospective passengers!

            Part of a group of ten passengers, we listened intently to our pilot’s briefing. There were no seat belt and
            no-smoking signs to observe, and the operation of mobile phones and CD players would not affect the
            technology
            of this particular aircraft. Landing was to be the big thing. We were instructed, quite sternly, that as the
            balloon descended, we must crouch down facing backwards – and HAND ON. We were obliged to actually practise
            this
            procedure so that those who understood little or no English would be left in no doubt as to what was
            required.
            At that stage, none of us could foresee just how exciting our landing would be.
